# Acoustic_Synth_With_Python
This script generates the sound of acoustic instruments with a numerical approximation following this article: http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2007/ph210/pelc2/

Then the program uses pyaudio to play the sound on the speakers mixed with GUI built in pygame where the user can play the sounds with the computer keyboard.The GUI displays a keyboard that responds to the user input and has different options to choose, like instrument selection, octave and volume.

It's also very easy to add presets to the prograrm following the logic of the first lines of code in the acoustic_synth.py file.
